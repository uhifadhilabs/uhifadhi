/**
 * THE FOUR GROUPS THE SIDEBAR DRAWS, AND WHAT EACH ONE MEANS.
 *
 * A group is a PLACE in the sidebar, not a thing a module owns, and there are
 * exactly four of them. They are named here, in the order they are drawn, so
 * that a module joins one by CONSTANT instead of by retyping a string: a
 * near-miss label ("Organisation", "system", "Org") used to make a fifth
 * heading rather than an error, and a sidebar with two Systems in it answers
 * "where am I" with a lie.
 *
 * WHAT EACH GROUP HOLDS — the meaning, written where the constants are,
 * because a module author choosing between them reads this and nothing else:
 *
 *   OBSERVATORY   what the organisation WATCHES. Areas and everything under
 *                 them, Performance, and a module's organisation-level page
 *                 set. If it is a reading of the work, it belongs here.
 *   ORGANIZATION  what the organisation IS AND HOLDS. Departments, Team,
 *                 Files. Not readings — the standing facts about the body
 *                 doing the work.
 *   SYSTEM        what the system RAISES TO YOU. Alerts, Telemetry. Rows that
 *                 exist because the installation has something to tell you,
 *                 rather than because you went looking.
 *   SETTINGS      configuration, and it comes LAST. One row with its tabs as
 *                 children today; the group may grow, which is why it is a
 *                 group and not a row filed under System.
 *
 * ORDER IS PUBLISHED, NOT NEGOTIATED. {@see self::ORDER} is the order the
 * shell draws the headings in, whatever order the container registered the
 * bundles in and whatever position a contribution declared —
 * `NavSection::$position` orders the ROWS inside a group, which is the
 * question a contributing module can actually answer.
 *
 * THE STRING VALUES ARE THE LABELS. A group's value is the heading as drawn,
 * so a module still on a literal keeps working; use the constant.
