/**
 * ONE OF A TOPIC'S FIVE HEADLINE FIGURES.
 *
 * FIVE, AND ALWAYS FIVE. A row of three where the design has five is a
 * different design, and a reader cannot tell a short row from a quiet
 * month — so a topic with less to say fills the slot with a figure that
 * states its own absence rather than dropping it.
 *
 * NULL IS NOT NOUGHT, HERE AS EVERYWHERE. A value nobody published reads
 * as "no figure yet"; a delta nobody can compute — because no period has
 * been written down yet — reads as "no history yet". The two are
 * different absences and the page says which.
