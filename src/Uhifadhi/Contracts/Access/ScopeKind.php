/**
 * HOW FAR A GRANT REACHES — four values, and not a fifth.
 *
 * A position says which of these kinds it ALLOWS; the person's placement says
 * which one they are actually placed at. That split is the model's one lever
 * over reach: a position meant to be local cannot be widened by mistake when
 * somebody is assigned, because the wider kind is not on offer.
 *
 * NOT EVERY CONCERN OFFERS EVERY KIND. Ground concerns — areas, zones,
 * stations — offer organization or area, because ground is where it is. Team
 * concerns offer organization or department. {@see self::Own} is whatever the
 * module says it is, in its own words, and appears under that module's group
 * and nowhere else.
 *
 * ONE THING SCOPE IS NEVER DECIDED BY: who recorded the thing. A page is
 * scoped by the ground and the department it belongs to, never by whose name
 * is on the record.
