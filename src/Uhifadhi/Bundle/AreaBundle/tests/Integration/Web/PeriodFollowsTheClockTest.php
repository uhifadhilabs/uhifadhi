/**
 * WHICH MONTH A PAGE IS ABOUT FOLLOWS THE CLOCK, AND THE CLOCK ONLY.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS PINS. "This month's figures" was decided separately in
 * eleven places across two bundles, each writing
 * `FigurePeriod::month(new \DateTimeImmutable())`. Every one asked the WALL
 * CLOCK, so every one turned over on the 1st with nothing able to pin it —
 * and two surfaces rendered either side of midnight on the last of the month
 * could caption two different months in one reading.
 *
 * SO THE BOUNDARY IS THE TEST, and it is asked of the whole wiring rather
 * than of the class: the container is built at an instant, the service is
 * resolved out of it, and what it answers has to move with the instant. A
 * unit test of the period source proves the arithmetic; this proves that the
 * clock actually reaches the page.
