/**
 * THE THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN TO A ZONE SET, and the whole of them.
 *
 * THE HISTORY IS LINES, NOT GEOMETRY. No superseded ring is kept anywhere, so
 * an entry cannot be undone and is not meant to be: it answers "what happened
 * to this set, and who", and an earlier scheme is seen again only by importing
 * its file again.
 *
 * A REFUSED FILE IS AN EVENT TOO. Nothing changed, which is exactly why it is
 * worth a line: somebody tried, and the next person needs to know the attempt
 * was made and why it did not take.
 *
 * The backing value is what the column stores, so it is a stable word and not
 * the case name.
