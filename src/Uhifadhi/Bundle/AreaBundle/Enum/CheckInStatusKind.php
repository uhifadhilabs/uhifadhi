/**
 * WHAT A CHECK-IN STATUS *MEANS*, as against what it is called.
 *
 * THE WORDS ARE THE ORGANISATION'S AND THE MEANINGS ARE THE PLATFORM'S.
 * An area writes its own statuses — "At post", "On escort", "Court
 * appearance", "Sick" — and every one of them is one of these four
 * kinds. The label is what a ranger taps; the kind is what the product
 * can reason about: whether a station is required, and whether the
 * person counts as on duty.
 *
 * FOUR, BECAUSE FOUR IS WHAT CHANGES AN ANSWER. Anything finer is a
 * reason, and a reason is a note or a status of its own with the same
 * kind: "on escort" and "at a hearing" are both working elsewhere, and
 * nothing downstream treats them differently.
 *
 * A KIND IS NEVER SENT BY THE HANDSET. The phone sends the KEY of a
 * status the area published; the kind travels the other way, in the
 * roster read, so the app knows which status needs a post.
 *
 * @see API-CONTRACT.md §13A, §13D
