/**
 * WHAT THE READER ASKED THE BOARD FOR, read off the query string.

 * SERVER-SIDE, AND THE ADDRESS IS THE STATE. A filtered board is a link
 * somebody can send, a page a browser can go back to, and a view that works
 * with no script; a board filtered in the browser is none of those and is
 * also a board that lies about its counts the moment it is longer than a page.
 *
 * AN UNKNOWN VALUE FILTERS NOTHING rather than emptying the board. A stale
 * link naming a department that has been renamed should show the post, not an
 * empty card with no way to tell why.
