 * THE STATION REGISTER AS ONE PAGE OF IT IS DRAWN: the rows in the window,

 *
 * THE CARD IS BOUNDED BY A PAGE, NOT BY A SCROLLBAR. Eight rows, the count on
 * the left and the pages on the right — the list idiom this product uses
 * everywhere — so a card in a column keeps its height whether an area has
 * three posts or three hundred.
 *
 * THE SCOPE A COUNT IS "OF" IS THE ACTIVE SCOPE, never the whole table. "3 of
 * 12 stations" while the register is showing the active ones means three of
 * the twelve active ones, and the inactive tail is stated separately rather
 * than folded into a number that would then mean neither thing.
