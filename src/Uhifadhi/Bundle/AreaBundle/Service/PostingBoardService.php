/**
 * THE PEOPLE POSTED SOMEWHERE, AS A BOARD: the lines, what the filters offer,
 * and how many each would leave.
 *
 * THE FACETS ARE COUNTED AGAINST THE WHOLE BOARD and the lines are what
 * survives the filter — two different questions of the same set, which is why
 * both come out of one pass here rather than out of two queries that could
 * disagree about what "the board" is.
 *
 * FILTERED IN PHP, NOT IN SQL, and that is a size judgement rather than a
 * shortcut: a post has five people, an area has thirty, and the role and the
 * department are not columns of this bundle at all — they arrive from a seam,
 * keyed by uuid, so a WHERE clause could not see them. The day a board is
 * thousands of rows this is the thing to revisit, and the query object is
 * already the shape that would move into SQL.
 *
 * THE SEAM MAY ANSWER FOR NOBODY. An installation with no provider gets rows
 * with no role and no department, empty facets, and a board that draws its
 * lines without those two columns — which {@see PostingFacets::knowsRoles()}
 * is how the template asks.
