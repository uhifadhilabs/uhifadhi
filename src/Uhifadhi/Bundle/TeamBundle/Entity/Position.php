/**
 * A named position that bundles a set of granular permissions. An administrator
 * defines positions and ticks their permissions; every Staff user assigned a
 * position inherits them, and a Staff user with no position holds nothing at
 * all. Super Admin and Admin ignore positions — they hold everything by tier.
 *
 * A POSITION BELONGS TO A DEPARTMENT, AND ITS NAME IS UNIQUE ONLY INSIDE IT.
 * The previous release enforced `unique(name)` across the whole installation
 * and said in this very docblock that the rule it wanted was department-scoped
 * but could not be written, because a department was somebody else's entity.
 * It is this module's entity now ({@see Department}) for exactly that reason: a
 * constraint cannot be spelled across a module boundary. So the index is
 * `unique(department, name)`, and *Ecology / Analyst* and *Protection Service /
 * Analyst* are two jobs that share a word.
 *
 * The consequence reaches every screen and is not negotiable there: a position
 * is written DEPARTMENT-FIRST, never as a bare name. A bare "Analyst" is not a
 * shorter way of saying the same thing — it is a different and ambiguous thing.
 *
 * THE DEPARTMENT IS NULLABLE, and the null is a state rather than an unfinished
 * field: a position created before anybody decided which department owns it is
 * a position that exists, and the roster's Unassigned band is where its holders
 * appear. Postgres treats NULL as distinct in a unique index, so two
 * department-less positions may share a name — which is the honest behaviour
 * for rows nobody has filed yet, and it resolves itself the moment they are.

     * A setter taking the core enum alone is the obvious one to reach for and

     * administrator would tick a module's row, save, and watch it come back
     * unticked with nothing anywhere saying why.
     *
     * The live catalogue is a REQUIRED second argument rather than something
     * this entity fetches, because an entity that reached for a service to
     * validate itself would be an entity you cannot construct in a test — and
     * because making it required is what stops the unvalidated call from
     * existing at all.
     *
     * WHAT IS ACCEPTED is the live catalogue UNION the strings this position
     * already holds, and the union is the design:
     *
     *   · the catalogue half makes an unknown NEW string fail loudly;
     *   · the already-held half is the prune-not-purge ruling in code. A module
     *     uninstalled last week left grants behind in positions' JSON; those
     *     values are in nobody's catalogue now, and saving an unrelated change
     *     to the position must not quietly strip them. Editing a position is
     *     not a migration. They stay, they stop resolving, the matrix draws
     *     them muted, and revoking one still works — it is a grant, not a
     *     fixture.
