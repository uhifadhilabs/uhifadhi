/**
 * ONE LINE OF A DEPARTMENT'S SCOPE HISTORY — who changed the scope, when, why,
 * and which way it went.
 *
 * Changing a department's scope is not like renaming it. Confining an org-wide
 * department to a single area re-scopes everything filed under it, and — now the
 * area-aware voter reads the department's scope as authority
 * (docs/area-scoped-authority.md) — promoting an area-level department to
 * org-wide hands every one of its people authority in every area. A change with
 * that reach is not something the current state can
 * explain after the fact: the department ends up org-wide either way, and the row
 * itself cannot say it used to be Ngorongoro's, who widened it, or why. This
 * entity is that record, written on the transition and never edited afterwards.
 *
 * IT IS AN APPEND-ONLY LEDGER. Nothing here has a setter. The four facts are
 * fixed at construction — {@see Department::changeScopeTo()} is the only thing
 * that builds one — because an audit line you can edit is an audit line that
 * proves nothing. It carries a `recordedAt` set at construction rather than the
 * usual persist-time timestamp: the "when" of an audit event is when the event
 * happened, not when the row reached the database.
 *
 * THE ACTOR AND THE AREA ARE NULLED, NEVER CASCADED. `changedBy` is SET NULL
 * because the person who confined a department may themselves be deactivated
 * later, and this module never deletes an account anyway — but even a future
 * purge must not take the history of what they did with them. The `area` is SET
 * NULL for the same reason: the audit outlives the area it names. Only the
 * department cascades, because a scope-change history belongs to its department
 * and means nothing without it.
