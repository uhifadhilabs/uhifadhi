/**
 * A part of the organisation that owns positions — Ecology, Protection Service,
 * Administration.
 *
 * THIS BUNDLE OWNS IT. Treating a department as an organizational lens owned
 * elsewhere makes a position's name unique across the whole installation, which
 * is wrong about the organisations this product is for. Ecology has an Analyst
 * and Protection Service has an Analyst: two different jobs, different
 * permission sets, one word between them. A model that forbids the pair forces
 * one of them to be renamed to something nobody in the building says out
 * loud.
 *
 * So the department lives here, beside the position whose name it scopes,
 * because a constraint cannot be spelled across a module boundary:
 * `unique(department, name)` needs both columns in one table's index, and an
 * entity somewhere else could not supply one of them. Owning it is not a claim
 * on what a department MEANS to the rest of the product — another module wanting
 * departments as a lens over its own records points at this entity the way it
 * points at a person, through the contract, and nothing here has to know.
 *
 * A DEPARTMENT NAME IS UNIQUE PER SCOPE, NOT ORG-WIDE. Two protected areas each
 * run their own Anti-Poaching unit — two units that share a word, the way two
 * departments each carry an Analyst — so a name is unique WITHIN one area, and
 * within the org-wide bucket (a null area), and the two are independent. See the
 * two partial unique indexes on the table below.
 *
 * A DEPARTMENT GRANTS NOTHING TODAY. It is an organizational fact and not an
 * authorization one: every capability an installation has still arrives through
 * a position's permissions. Banding the roster by department re-orders a page;
 * it never changes what anybody may do.
 *
 * IT CARRIES A SCOPE, AND THE SCOPE IS AN AREA OR THE ABSENCE OF ONE. A
 * department belongs either to the whole organisation ({@see $area} is null —
 * org-level, spanning every area) or to one area ({@see $area} is set —
 * area-level, belonging to that area alone). The scope is DERIVED from the
 * nullable area and never stored beside it ({@see getScope()}), because a stored
 * scope and a nullable area are two facts that drift apart and then one is lying.
 * The area is referenced through the platform's {@see AreaInterface} contract
 * (published by uhifadhi/contracts) and
 * resolved by whichever package provides the installation's area entity
 * (AreaBundle), so this bundle points at an area without ever requiring
 * an area package — the same arrangement by which a module points at a person.
 *
 * THE SCOPE IS CHANGEABLE, AND EVERY CHANGE IS AUDITED. {@see changeScopeTo()}
 * is the one door: it refuses a change with no reason, moves the area, and
 * appends a {@see DepartmentScopeChange} recording who, when, why, and which way.
 * A scope change reaches further than a rename — confining an org-wide department
 * re-scopes everything under it — so the transition leaves a record the current
 * state could never reconstruct.
 *
 * THE SCOPE IS ALSO AUTHORITY. An area-level department is the unit that
 * confines a Staff member's authority, and the area-aware
 * {@see \Uhifadhi\Bundle\TeamBundle\Security\PermissionVoter} reads exactly this chain:
 * `authority-area(person) = person.position.department.scope`, org-level (null)
 * meaning every area. So confining a department, or promoting one, now moves the
 * authority of everyone filed under it — which is what makes the scope-change
 * audit ({@see changeScopeTo()}) load-bearing rather than cosmetic. A department
 * still GRANTS nothing directly: capability arrives through a position's
 * permissions; the department only says WHERE those permissions reach.
