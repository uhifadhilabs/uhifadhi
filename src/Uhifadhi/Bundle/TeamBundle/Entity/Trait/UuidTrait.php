/**
 * Gives an entity a public, time-ordered UUIDv7 used for external addressing (URLs,
 * APIs) so the sequential integer primary key is never exposed. Generated on first
 * persist; the entity needs #[ORM\HasLifecycleCallbacks].
 *
 * COPIED, NOT SHARED, and deliberately: RegistryBundle carries its own
 * copy of this same twenty lines. A trait hoisted into the contracts would
 * put a Doctrine mapping into a package whose whole point is that it depends on
 * nothing, and would make every module's schema hostage to a contracts release.
 * Twenty lines duplicated is cheaper than that coupling.
