/**
 * THE ONE ROW THIS BUNDLE PUTS IN THE SIDEBAR.
 *
 * Team is the platform-wide row the shell's navigation contract is documented to expect
 * from a module: "the rare platform-wide row that belongs to nobody's area". It
 * is deliberately not the other thing a module can be — a per-area capability
 * registered with the registry through `ModuleProviderInterface` — because that
 * contract is per-area by construction (the registry's ledger is an area-by-module
 * table) and an installation's people are not an area's. A team that had to be
 * switched on per area would be a roster that existed four times.
 *
 * TWO ROWS, AND THE SECOND ONE IS NOT A SCREEN INSIDE THE FIRST. /team and
 * /team/positions are one place in the product, so the matrix lights the Team
 * row rather than adding a third; anything below that is the page's own
 * business, not the sidebar's. Departments is different in kind and the drawing
 * says so — Departments and Team sit side by side under Organization, in that
 * order, because a department is an org-wide fact the roster reads rather than
 * a corner of the roster. It has its own top-level address for the same
 * reason.
 *
 * ONE SECTION, THOUGH. Both rows are Organization, and a module contributing
 * two sections for two screens would be a module deciding the shape of somebody
 * else's sidebar.
 *
 * GATING IS THIS CLASS'S JOB, not the shell's — the shell holds no
 * authorization service and asks nothing about the viewer. So the row is
 * ABSENT, never hidden, for anybody without `team.manage`, which is the exact
 * permission the screens behind it are gated on. A row that offered a door
 * closing in somebody's face would be worse than no row.
 *
 * ROUTE-TOLERANT. The addresses are mounted by the APPLICATION (the recipe's
 * config/routes/team.yaml, which an installation may edit or delete), so
 * generating one can fail — and a sidebar that took every page down because
 * somebody unmounted a route would be the worst possible way to learn it. No
 * route, no row.
 *
 * BUILT PER CALL, NEVER CACHED, and nothing is done in the constructor: the
 * shell reads its sources live on every render precisely so a permission
 * revoked this morning is gone from the sidebar this morning.
