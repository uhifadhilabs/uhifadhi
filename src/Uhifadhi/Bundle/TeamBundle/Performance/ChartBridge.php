/**
 * A CHART A TOPIC STATED, HANDED TO THE ATLAS THAT DRAWS IT.
 *
 * TWO SHAPES FOR ONE THING, AND THAT IS ON PURPOSE. A topic states its
 * chart in the CONTRACTS package, which depends on nothing — a module
 * publishing a topic must not have to install a drawing library to
 * describe a series. The atlas's own shape is the drawing one. The
 * translation is a dozen lines and it belongs to the host, which is the
 * only party that has both.
 *
 * THE TWO ENUMS ARE KEPT IN STEP BY VALUE, not by a match arm per case:
 * a kind added to the contract and not to the atlas should fail where
 * it is drawn rather than silently become a bar.
