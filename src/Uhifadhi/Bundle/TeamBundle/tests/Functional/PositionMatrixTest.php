/**
 * THE PERMISSION MATRIX, RENDERED AND SAVED.
 *
 * What is asserted here is what makes this matrix different from every other
 * permission matrix, and what a template can get wrong about it:
 *
 *   · the per-module groups are CLEARLY BOUNDED and each names its contributor;
 *   · every row carries the sentence that says what holding it does;
 *   · an installed module that declares nothing is DRAWN, not skipped;
 *   · an orphaned grant is drawn muted and SURVIVES a save that does not touch
 *     it, because editing a position is not a migration;
 *   · a module-declared permission round-trips through the save.
