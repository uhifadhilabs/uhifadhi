/**
 * SELECT ALL, PER UMBRELLA — AND ONLY WHERE THERE IS JAVASCRIPT TO DO IT.
 *
 * The design draws the umbrella's count as a button: "all · 1 of 4", pressed to
 * tick or untick that module's whole group. It is a convenience over the rows
 * that are already there, so it is shipped the only way a convenience may be
 * shipped on a screen that also has to work without JavaScript: as a
 * PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT.
 *
 * WHAT THAT MEANS HERE, EXACTLY:
 *
 *   · The matrix is unchanged without it. The rows are real checkboxes in a
 *     real form, and every one of them can still be ticked and saved by hand —
 *     there is no path through this screen that requires the button.
 *   · The control ships INERT and the controller makes it live. It renders
 *     `disabled`, and the Stimulus controller's connect() is what enables it.
 *     A control that looks operable and is not is worse than no control (the
 *     shell's whole furniture spec exists because of that failure), and a
 *     `<button>` whose behaviour never arrived is exactly that. Disabled, it
 *     reads as the count span it has always been, and it says so to a screen
 *     reader instead of lying about it.
 *   · It writes nothing. Ticking is a change to the boxes and no more; the
 *     matrix's no-surprise write model is unmoved — nothing reaches the
 *     database until Save is pressed, which is the same sentence the save bar
 *     has always carried.
 *
 * The rest of this file is the wiring, pinned end to end EXCEPT the click,
 * which is a browser's business: that the markup names a controller, that the
 * controller is in the package, that the package declares it under the name the
 * host will enable, and that the identifier in the template is the one
 * StimulusBundle derives from the package name. This is team's FIRST controller,
 * so every one of those links is new here and none of them have ever been
 * exercised.
