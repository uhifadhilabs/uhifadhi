/**
 * THE ROW IN THE SIDEBAR — asserted as markup a browser received, because that
 * is where the defect was.
 *
 * A module with screens and no row is a module reachable only by somebody who
 * already knows the URL, which is the same as not shipping it. The platform's
 * one sentence is "a module registers with the registry and renders in the shell",
 * and the second half of it is this file.
 *
 * THE INTERESTING QUESTIONS ARE ASKED FROM OFF THE PAGE. Whether the row is
 * there at all is only half of it; the other half is who sees it, and a suite
 * that only ever asked from /team would have to sign in as somebody who can
 * reach /team before it could ask. So most of these requests go to
 * `/_elsewhere` — a page in the shell's frame that is nobody's module (see
 * ShellPageController) — which is the position a real viewer is in.
 *
 * GATING IS THE SOURCE'S JOB, and the shell says so: a row a viewer may not
 * have is ABSENT, never hidden, because a hidden row leaks its existence to
 * whoever reads the HTML. So the assertions below are about the string not
 * being in the response at all.
