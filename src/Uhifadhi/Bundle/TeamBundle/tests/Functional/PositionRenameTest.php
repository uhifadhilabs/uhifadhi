/**
 * RENAME, FROM THE PANE HEADER THE DESIGN DRAWS IT IN.
 *
 * `team_position_rename` existed, was gated, was tested through a hand-built
 * POST — and no page linked it. A route nobody can reach is a feature nobody
 * has, and the design had drawn where it goes all along: the pane header's
 * right-hand group, beside the position's name.
 *
 * ONE DEVIATION FROM THE DRAWING, STATED OUT LOUD. The design draws a bare
 * `Rename` button. The route needs a name, and a static page has nowhere to put
 * the thing that collects one, so the header renders the field the button
 * submits — prefilled with the name it is about. The alternative was a button
 * that opens something nobody has designed yet, or a button that does nothing,
 * and the second is the failure this bundle has already shipped once.
 *
 * DELETE IS NOT HERE. The design draws it next to Rename and its semantics are
 * a question nobody has answered — what happens to the people holding the
 * position — so it stays undrawn until somebody rules on it. Rendering a
 * destructive control ahead of its ruling is how the ruling gets made by
 * accident.
 *
 * THE HEADER LIVES INSIDE THE PERMISSIONS FORM, and forms do not nest. The
 * rename form is a sibling of it and the header's controls join it by `form=`,
 * which is what that attribute is for: two independent writes on one pane, and
 * neither can post the other's fields.
