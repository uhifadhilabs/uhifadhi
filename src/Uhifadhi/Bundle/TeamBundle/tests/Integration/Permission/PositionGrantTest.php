/**
 * THERE IS ONE WRITE PATH ONTO A POSITION, AND IT VALIDATES.
 *
 * There used to be two. `setPermissions(PermissionEnum[])` took the core enum
 * and was the obvious one to reach for — and it SILENTLY DISCARDED every
 * module-declared permission, because a module's value is not a case of an enum
 * this module owns. An administrator ticking a patrol module's row and saving
 * would watch it come back unticked, with nothing anywhere saying why. The
 * setter is removed rather than deprecated: a call site left compiling is the
 * bug still shipping.
 *
 * What replaces it is the value-string surface, and it takes the live catalogue
 * as a second required argument, so it cannot be called without one. The
 * accepted set is:
 *
 *     the live catalogue  ∪  the strings this position already holds
 *
 * The union is the whole design. The left half is what makes an unknown NEW
 * string fail loudly instead of being quietly dropped. The right half is the
 * prune-not-purge ruling in code: a module uninstalled last week left grants
 * behind in positions' JSON, those values are in nobody's catalogue any more,
 * and saving an unrelated change to the position must not silently strip them.
 * Editing a position is not a migration.
