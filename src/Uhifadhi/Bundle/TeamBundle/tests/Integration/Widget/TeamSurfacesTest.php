/**
 * BOTH TEAM SCREENS ARE WIDGET SURFACES, and this bundle hard-requires
 * ShellBundle to make that true.
 *
 * The standing workspace rule is that a drawn direction ships as a built-in
 * preset carrying its trade-off line verbatim — adopted, copied and mixed, never
 * picked and never thrown away. No option set is a ballot. So all six roster
 * directions and all six matrix directions are here, each under the words the
 * design used for it, and the shipped composition is the seventh card the strip
 * leads with.
 *
 * A CATALOGUE IS CODE, NOT INPUT: a preset naming a widget the surface does not
 * ship, or a width it does not offer, refuses to boot. That is the framework
 * agreeing, and it is why constructing both catalogues is itself worth a test.
