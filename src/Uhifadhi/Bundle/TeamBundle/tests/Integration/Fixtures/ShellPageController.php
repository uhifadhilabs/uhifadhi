/**
 * SOMEBODY ELSE'S PAGE, in the shell's frame — a stand-in for whatever screen an
 * installation happens to be on when it is not on one of this bundle's.
 *
 * The sidebar suite needs one, because the interesting questions about a nav row
 * are asked from OFF it: does a colleague without team.manage see it, and is it
 * lit when it should not be. A suite that could only ever ask from /team would
 * answer neither.
 *
 * IT SITS BEHIND THE FIREWALL LIKE EVERY OTHER PAGE. The documented
 * access_control is default-closed, so this page is reachable by a signed-in
 * viewer and by nobody else — which is why the anonymous case in that suite is
 * a redirect to /login rather than a sidebar with nothing in it.
 *
 * The template is built inline rather than shipped as a file, so the test kernel
 * keeps its promise of adding no twig paths: every template this bundle renders
 * is its own.
