/**
 * THE HOST'S AREA, PLAYED BY A STAND-IN — the area an area-level department is
 * confined to.
 *
 * An area belongs to the host application; a real installation resolves
 * {@see AreaInterface} to its own entity with
 * `doctrine.orm.resolve_target_entities`, and `AreaBundle` is the
 * package that answers it. This bundle never resolves the interface itself — it
 * only points at it, exactly as its {@see \Uhifadhi\Bundle\TeamBundle\Entity\Department}
 * points a nullable association at it. So the suites need a host to play, and
 * this is it: a real entity implementing the interface, resolved to by the two
 * test kernels alone (see TestKernel and the Resolution kernel).
 *
 * IT DELIBERATELY MIRRORS the registry's own fixture area — the same shape a
 * real host area carries: a sequential id the association is built on, and a
 * public UUIDv7 for addressing. The interface asks for nothing but identity, so
 * everything past `getId()` is the host's business, present here only so a test
 * can name the area it confined a department to.
