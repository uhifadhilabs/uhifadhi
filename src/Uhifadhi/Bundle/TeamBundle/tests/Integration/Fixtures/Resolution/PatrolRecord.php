/**
 * ANY MODULE THAT KEEPS A RECORD WITH A NAME ON IT — who led the patrol, who
 * reported the incident, whose dashboard layout this is.
 *
 * It points at the CONTRACT and not at this bundle's `User`, which is the whole
 * arrangement: a module that type-hinted `Uhifadhi\Bundle\TeamBundle\Entity\User` would be a
 * module no installation could run without this one.
 *
 * A FIXTURE RATHER THAN THE WIDGET MODULE'S OWN ENTITY, deliberately. Widget's
 * `WidgetPreference` does exactly this and is present in require-dev, so the
 * whole suite already proves the resolution works — but a test that asserted it
 * THROUGH widget would be a test about widget, and would go quiet the day this
 * module's dev dependencies changed. This class exists so the claim is about
 * team's own prepend and depends on nothing else.
