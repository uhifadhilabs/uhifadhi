/**
 * THE SMALLEST HOST THE QUESTION CAN HONESTLY BE ASKED IN: framework, twig,
 * doctrine, security and this bundle, plus one module's entity pointing at the
 * contract.
 *
 * SMALLEST does not mean fewest bundles — it means nothing present that could
 * ANSWER the question on team's behalf. Every bundle here is one team requires
 * outright: it draws screens (twig), a team bundle in an installation with no
 * firewall would be a user table nobody can ever become (security), and both
 * its surfaces are widget surfaces (widget). A kernel that dropped any of them
 * would compile nothing and prove nothing.
 *
 * WIDGET ASKS THE QUESTION, IT DOES NOT ANSWER IT — its `WidgetPreference`
 * points at the same contract and its bundle prepends no resolution of its own,
 * which is checked rather than assumed. So the only package here that could
 * have supplied the answer is team, and the assertions are about team.
 *
 * The whole point is what is ABSENT from `configureContainer()`: there is no
 * `resolve_target_entities` here, because an installation should not have to
 * write one.
