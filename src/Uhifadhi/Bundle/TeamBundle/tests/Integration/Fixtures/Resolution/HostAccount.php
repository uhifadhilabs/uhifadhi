/**
 * AN INSTALLATION THAT HAS ITS OWN ACCOUNT CLASS — the escape hatch.
 *
 * This module prepends a resolution so that nobody has to write one, and
 * prepended configuration LOSES to the application's own by Symfony's design.
 * That is not a limitation being worked around: it is exactly the property that
 * makes the default safe to ship. An installation whose people are its own
 * entity says so in its `doctrine.yaml` and its answer wins, with nothing here
 * to disable first.
 *
 * It answers the contract's seven questions and nothing else, because that is
 * all the contract asks.
