/**
 * TEAM ANSWERS THE USER CONTRACT, SO TEAM SAYS SO — and an installation writes
 * nothing.
 *
 * Nearly every module keeps records with a name on them and points at
 * `Uhifadhi\Contracts\Entity\UserInterface` rather than at this bundle's
 * `User`, because a module that type-hinted the latter would be a module no
 * installation could run without this one. Something has to close that loop.
 *
 * IT USED TO BE A DOCUMENTED HAND-STEP, and that was the wrong shape. The line
 * an installation was told to paste says exactly one thing —
 * "`UserInterface` means `Uhifadhi\Bundle\TeamBundle\Entity\User`" — and the package best
 * placed to know that is the package that provides the answer. A hand-step is
 * for a decision only the installation can make; this was not one. Its cost was
 * real: forget it and the container still boots, the kernel still starts, and
 * `doctrine:migrations:diff` stops on "Class
 * 'Uhifadhi\Contracts\Entity\UserInterface' does not exist" — a failure
 * a long way from its cause.
 *
 * SO THE BUNDLE PREPENDS IT ({@see \Uhifadhi\Bundle\TeamBundle\TeamBundle::prependExtension()}),
 * and the whole of this suite already depends on that: the test kernel writes no
 * resolution, so if the prepend stopped happening every integration test here
 * would fail at once. These two assertions are the ones that say so ON PURPOSE
 * rather than as a side effect, in the smallest host the question can be asked
 * in — framework, doctrine, this bundle, and one module's entity.
 *
 * THE ESCAPE HATCH IS SYMFONY'S OWN RULE, not a switch this module invented:
 * prepended configuration LOSES to the application's. An installation whose
 * people are its own entity names that entity in its `doctrine.yaml` and its
 * answer wins, with nothing here to turn off first. That property is what makes
 * the default safe to ship, so it is tested rather than assumed.
