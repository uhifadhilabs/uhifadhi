/**
 * A DEPARTMENT NAME IS UNIQUE PER AREA, NOT ACROSS THE INSTALLATION.
 *
 * The previous release made a department name unique org-wide, on the reading
 * that there is one organisation and two departments by one name would be the
 * same department entered twice. That is right for the org-wide bucket and wrong
 * for the areas beneath it. Two protected areas each run their own Anti-Poaching
 * unit; forbidding the pair would force one of them to be renamed to something
 * nobody on that area says out loud.
 *
 * So the rule is scoped: within one area a name is unique, within the org-wide
 * bucket (a null area) a name is unique, and the two buckets are independent.
 * The constraint is two partial unique indexes rather than one global one —
 * `unique(name, area_id)` alone would let two org-level rows share a name,
 * because in SQL two NULLs are distinct.
