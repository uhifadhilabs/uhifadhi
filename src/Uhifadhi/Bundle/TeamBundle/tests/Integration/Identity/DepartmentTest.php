/**
 * A DEPARTMENT IS A REAL ENTITY AND THIS MODULE OWNS IT.
 *
 * The previous release argued the opposite: a department was called an
 * organizational lens another module owns, and a position's name was therefore
 * unique across the whole installation. That was wrong about the organisations
 * this product is for. Two departments really do carry the same post — Ecology
 * has an Analyst and Protection Service has an Analyst, and they are two
 * different jobs with different permission sets that happen to share a word. A
 * model forbidding the pair forces one of them to be renamed to something
 * nobody says out loud.
 *
 * So the constraint is `unique(department, name)`, and the org-wide one is
 * gone. A position's name is unique INSIDE its department and nowhere else.
