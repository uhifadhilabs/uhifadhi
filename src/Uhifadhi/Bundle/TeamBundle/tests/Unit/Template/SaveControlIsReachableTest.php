/**
 * THE SAVE BUTTON THE STYLESHEET HID.
 *
 * A real installation found this one: the matrix rendered, the boxes ticked,
 * the tick mirrored — and there was no way to save. `_w_matrix_b` shipped its
 * save bar as `class="pm-save clean"`, and the stylesheet carried
 * `.pm-save.clean .acts .cta { display: none; }`. The bar was a static frame in
 * the design app, where "clean" is a state a script leaves the moment a box is
 * ticked; ported into a page THAT SHIPS NO JAVASCRIPT AT ALL, "clean" is the
 * only state there is, so the primary was hidden permanently.
 *
 * NOTHING THAT TALKS HTTP COULD SEE IT. Every save test in this suite
 * hand-builds its POST, and DomCrawler does not apply CSS — so the endpoint,
 * the token, the redirect and the persistence were all green while the screen
 * was unusable. The join is between a template's classes and a stylesheet's
 * rules, and it is read as TEXT here for the same reason ShellBundle reads
 * its script as text: a mismatch across two files fails only in a browser.
 *
 * The rule is general rather than a check for one class name: whatever state
 * the stylesheet uses to hide the save bar's primary, no shipped template may
 * render the bar already in it.
