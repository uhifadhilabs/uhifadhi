/**
 * ANYTHING THAT ASKS FOR THE FULL WIDTH AND THEN PADS ITSELF SAYS SO.
 *
 * `width: 100%` is the width of the CONTENT box unless a rule says otherwise, so
 * a rule that also carries padding or a border asks for its container's whole
 * width and then adds its own to the outside of it. The element ends up wider
 * than the thing containing it, by exactly the padding and border it declared.
 *
 * That is not a hypothetical. `.rail-item` is 11px of padding and a 1px border
 * on top of `width: 100%`, and on /team/positions it rendered 24px wider than
 * the rail's content box — every position card in the left rail crossed the
 * rail's own border and sat on top of the pane beside it.
 *
 * IT LOOKS RIGHT IN THE DESIGN FOR TWO REASONS THIS BUNDLE HAS NEITHER OF. The
 * static replica loads a `*{box-sizing:border-box}` reset, and it draws the rail
 * item as a `<button>`, which browsers already size as a border box. Neither
 * survives the port: ShellBundle ships tokens and furniture and
 * deliberately no reset layer (an application's Tailwind build owns utilities),
 * and the rail item here is an `<a href>`, because in the real surface it is a
 * link to a position and not a button. A `<div>` or an `<a>` gets content-box,
 * and the design's two accidental protections both disappear at once.
 *
 * So the sheet declares it. Where the element is already a border box the
 * declaration changes nothing — it is the floor for the rule that is written
 * next, and forgetting is invisible until somebody opens the page.
