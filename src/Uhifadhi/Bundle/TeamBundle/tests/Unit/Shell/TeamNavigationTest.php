 * Both are the same kind of failure and it is the worst kind a nav source has:
 * an exception thrown while building the sidebar takes down EVERY page in the
 * installation, including the ones that had nothing to do with this module. So
 * they are asserted here rather than reasoned about.
 *
 * What a viewer actually sees is asserted where it belongs, against real markup
 * a browser received — see tests/Functional/SidebarRowTest.
