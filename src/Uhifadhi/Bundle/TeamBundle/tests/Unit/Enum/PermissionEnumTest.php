/**
 * THE CATALOGUE IS SEVEN, AND THE LIST IS WRITTEN OUT HERE.
 *
 * Not counted — spelled. A permission is a power somebody holds, so adding one
 * is a decision, and a test that only counted would let the eighth arrive by
 * accident and the wrong seventh be swapped in silently.
 *
 * THE SEVENTH IS `team.manage`, and it is what the retired Manager tier became.
 * Administering the team used to be answered by the tier column; it is now an
 * ordinary row in the matrix under its own umbrella, which is what makes "who
 * administers this installation" a question with a countable answer.
