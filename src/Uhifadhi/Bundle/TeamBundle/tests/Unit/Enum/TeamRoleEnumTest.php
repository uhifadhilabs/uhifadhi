/**
 * THE TIERS ARE THREE, AND THE LIST IS WRITTEN OUT HERE.
 *
 * Super Admin and Admin stand ABOVE the matrix — they are the bootstrap and the
 * recovery escape hatch, and they hold every permission by tier. Everybody else
 * is Staff and holds exactly what their position grants.
 *
 * THERE IS NO MANAGER, and its removal is the ruling that changed the most. The
 * tier named a job rather than a system level, and it produced the model's most
 * misread rule: a Manager could administer the team and yet hold no capability
 * at all. Administering the team is now an ordinary catalogue permission,
 * `team.manage`, granted through a position — so a "manager" is something an
 * administrator composes, and it is visible in the matrix, countable and
 * revocable, none of which was true of a tier.
