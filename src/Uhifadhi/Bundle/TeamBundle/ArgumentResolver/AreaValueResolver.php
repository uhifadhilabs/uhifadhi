/**
 * THE CONVENIENCE HALF OF THE AREA-AWARE VOTER'S CONTRACT — it turns a `{uuid}`
 * route parameter into the platform's area, so a controller can write
 * `isGranted('patrols.record', $area)` with `$area` resolved for it.
 *
 * The voter's subject is PASSED EXPLICITLY (DECISIONS §5.1, docs/area-scoped-authority.md §7.1):
 * the area is an argument, not something the voter reaches into the request stack
 * for. That is what makes the voter unit-testable and usable off-route (a
 * console command, an API call naming an area). This resolver is the sugar that
 * keeps the on-route path terse: type an action argument as {@see AreaInterface}
 * and the area addressed by the route's uuid is loaded and handed in.
 *
 * IT REACHES THE AREA THROUGH THE CONTRACT, NEVER AN AREA PACKAGE — the same
 * arrangement {@see \Uhifadhi\Bundle\TeamBundle\Controller\DepartmentController} uses: the
 * concrete class is whatever the installation resolved {@see AreaInterface} to
 * (AreaBundle, or the host's own), read off the association this module
 * already declares on {@see Department::$area}. So the resolver knows how to load
 * an area without ever naming the class that holds one.
 *
 * WHICH ROUTE PARAM. The argument's own name first (an action taking
 * `AreaInterface $area` reads an `{area}` param), then `{uuid}` by convention —
 * the address every area detail route carries. A param that is present but not a
 * valid, stored area is a 404: a named-but-unknown area is a wrong address, not a
 * silent null. Where NO such param is on the route, the resolver abstains
 * (yielding null only for a nullable argument), so it never fights the argument a
 * controller meant to fill some other way.
