 * the voter treat both identically; only core permissions may imply an umbrella
 * capability role — a module-declared permission never mints one (declared,
 * never granted).
 *
 * THE SENTENCE IS NOT OPTIONAL HERE EITHER. Both sides are required to supply
 * one — the core enum through {@see \Uhifadhi\Bundle\TeamBundle\Enum\PermissionEnum::description()},
 * a module through {@see \Uhifadhi\Contracts\ModulePermission} — so the
 * matrix never has to ask where a row came from before it knows whether it can
 * explain it. A nullable description would have made the answer "sometimes",
 * and a matrix that explains some of its rows is one an administrator stops
 * reading.
