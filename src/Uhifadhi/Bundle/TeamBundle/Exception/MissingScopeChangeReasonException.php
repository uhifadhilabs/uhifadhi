 * A DEPARTMENT'S SCOPE MAY NOT CHANGE WITHOUT A REASON.

 * The reason is not decoration — it is the payload of the audit entry the change
 * writes ({@see \Uhifadhi\Bundle\TeamBundle\Entity\DepartmentScopeChange}). A scope change
 * with a blank reason is an audit line that records who and when and leaves the
 * why empty, which is the one field an audit trail exists to hold. So the entity
 * refuses the change before it touches the area, rather than writing a record
 * that cannot answer the question it was created to answer.
