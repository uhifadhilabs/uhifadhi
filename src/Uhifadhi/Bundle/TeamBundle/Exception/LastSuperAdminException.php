/**
 * The change would have left the installation with no active Super Admin.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT IS A REFUSAL, NOT A GREYED-OUT BUTTON. A disabled control says
 * "not now" and leaves the reader guessing; this carries the reason, and the
 * screens print it where the control would have been. An installation must
 * always keep at least one ACTIVE Super Admin — demote or deactivate the last
 * one and there is nobody who can administer the team and no way back in.
 *
 * There is deliberately no owner flag and no break-glass account. Ownership is
 * simply transferable, and the only rule is that it may not reach zero: grant
 * Super Admin to a successor, confirm they can sign in, then have your own
 * account deactivated. That order works. The reverse is the one this refuses.
