/**
 * Decides a granular permission (e.g. `is_granted('patrols.record', $area)`) from the user's
 * tier, position, and — for an area-scoped permission — the TARGET AREA it is asked about.
 * Super Admin / Admin hold every permission in every area by tier; a Staff user holds exactly
 * the permissions of their assigned {@see \Uhifadhi\Bundle\TeamBundle\Entity\Position}, confined to their
 * authority-area.
 *
 * The catalogue — the app's own PermissionEnum plus what installed modules declare — is the
 * single source of what counts as a permission: core and module-declared values are decided
 * identically. Attributes outside the catalogue are none of this voter's business — it
 * abstains so the role voters can decide them, which also means a permission of an
 * UNINSTALLED module is simply no longer decidable here.
 *
 * AREA-SCOPED (docs/area-scoped-authority.md §4, the contracts). A permission now answers
 * "may this person do X *here*?" A Staff member's authority-area is a DERIVED fact — the scope
 * of their position's department (`user.getDepartment()?.getArea()`), org-level when null —
 * and nothing else stores it. The voter compares the passed target area against it:
 *
 *   1. TIER SHORT-CIRCUIT — Super Admin / Admin bypass area-scoping entirely; area never
 *      consulted. Area-scoping only ever narrows a Staff member.
 *   2. DOES THE POSITION CARRY THIS PERMISSION AT ALL? No position, or a position without the
 *      value → deny. Unchanged from before.
 *   3. IS THE PERMISSION EVEN AREA-SCOPED? A GLOBAL permission (only `area.create` among the
 *      core seven) is granted here with no area check — it has no area to compare against.
 *   4. AREA COMPARISON. Org-level authority (scope null) grants for any target — "all areas"
 *      is the absence of a boundary. A NULL subject means "no area in context" (a nav
 *      question, a "may I ever…?" flag): granted, because the actor has authority in some
 *      area, with the real per-area gate applying once an area is known. Otherwise the target
 *      area must equal the authority area.
 *
 * The subject is PASSED EXPLICITLY (DECISIONS §5.1), which is what makes the voter
 * unit-testable and usable off-route (commands, the API); {@see AreaValueResolver} is the
 * convenience that turns a `{uuid}` route param into the Area for controllers that want it.
 *
