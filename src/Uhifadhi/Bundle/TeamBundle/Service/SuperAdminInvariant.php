/**
 * AN INSTALLATION ALWAYS KEEPS AT LEAST ONE ACTIVE SUPER ADMIN.
 *
 * Demote or deactivate the last one and there is nobody who can administer the
 * team, nobody who can promote a replacement, and no way back in short of a
 * console session on the server. So the change is REFUSED — in code, here,
 * before anything is written.
 *
 * IT IS A REFUSAL AND NOT A DISABLED CONTROL. A greyed-out button says "not
 * now" and leaves the reader to guess; the screens call this, catch the
 * exception and print its reason where the control would have been. The
 * difference matters because the reason is also the instruction: grant Super
 * Admin to a successor and both refusals lift in the same moment.
 *
 * THERE IS NO OWNER FLAG AND NO BREAK-GLASS ACCOUNT. Both were considered and
 * both are worse. An owner flag makes one row in the table structurally
 * different and gives an installation a person it cannot replace when they
 * leave; a break-glass account is a credential nobody rotates. Ownership here is
 * simply transferable, and the only rule is that it may not reach zero.
 *
 * DEACTIVATED DOES NOT COUNT. The invariant is about who can actually sign in
 * and fix things, so a second Super Admin who left in March is not a second
 * Super Admin.
 *
 * WHY A SERVICE AND NOT THE ENTITY: an entity cannot count its own siblings,
 * and an invariant that only holds when the caller remembers to ask is not an
 * invariant. Every write path in this bundle goes through here.
