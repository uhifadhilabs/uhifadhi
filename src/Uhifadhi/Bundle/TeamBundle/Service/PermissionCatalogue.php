/**
 * THE SINGLE CATALOGUE OF EVERY PERMISSION THAT EXISTS IN THIS DEPLOYMENT:
 * the seven this module owns ({@see PermissionEnum}), plus whatever the
 * installed modules DECLARE through {@see ModuleProviderInterface::permissions()}.
 *
 * Declaring makes a permission assignable — it appears in the matrix and the
 * {@see \Uhifadhi\Bundle\TeamBundle\Security\PermissionVoter} recognises it — and nothing
 * more: no standing, no default holders. Uninstalling a module removes
 * its provider and its permissions vanish from the catalogue with it, on the
 * next request rather than the next deploy.
 *
 * EVERY ENTRY CARRIES ITS SENTENCE, whichever side wrote it: the core enum's
 * description() and a declaration's fourth string land in the same field, so
 * the matrix prints a row without asking where it came from.
 *
 * CORE ALWAYS WINS. A module redeclaring one of the seven is ignored, so no
 * module can relabel or shadow a permission this module owns; between two
 * modules colliding on a value the earlier registration holds. Never a merge,
 * never a fatal at boot — a third-party module must not be able to take an
 * installation down by picking a string.
 *
 * IT READS THE PROVIDERS LIVE. The tagged iterator is walked on every call, not
 * folded in the constructor, for the same reason the registry does it: what is
 * installed is a fact about the running container, not about deploy time.
