/**
 * The fixed catalogue of granular permissions a {@see \Uhifadhi\Bundle\TeamBundle\Entity\Position} can grant.
 * Each belongs to an umbrella (Areas, Modules, Team) with a specific action (View, Create, …) and
 * implies a coarse umbrella *capability role* an installation's access_control can name — so a
 * position holding any permission in an umbrella opens that whole region, while the granular
 * permission itself is checked by {@see \Uhifadhi\Bundle\TeamBundle\Security\PermissionVoter}.
 *
 * SEVEN, AND THE SEVENTH IS `team.manage`. It is what the retired Manager tier became: the tier
 * answered "may this person administer the team" invisibly, beside the matrix rather than in it,
 * and a second authority system running alongside the first is one nobody can audit. As a
 * permission the same authority is a row an administrator can see, count across the roster, and
 * take away — and it is granted the one way every other capability is, through a position.
 *
 * The Team umbrella carries exactly one row, and that is not an oversight. An umbrella is the
 * coarse region an installation's `access_control` names — `ROLE_TEAM` keeps `/team` shut — and
 * the granular row is what the voter then decides. One row today; the region is what the umbrella
 * is for.
 *
 * THERE IS NO INGESTION. An eighth case, `ingestion.run` under a `ROLE_INGESTION` umbrella,
 * existed here and is gone: this platform has no ingestion capability, and a permission that
 * guards nothing is a power an admin can assign over code that does not exist. Nothing else moved
 * with it — the two original umbrellas kept their values, their roles and their order, so a
 * position holding `area.edit` holds exactly what it held before.
 *
 * EVERY PERMISSION CARRIES A SENTENCE ({@see description()}), the core seven exactly as a
 * module-declared one does ({@see \Uhifadhi\Contracts\ModulePermission}). The matrix prints
 * it under the name, because "Areas · Delete" says which words were chosen and not what ticking
 * the box hands over. A core row without one would be the single row on that page an
 * administrator cannot read, and the rule is that there are no such rows.
 *
 * Single-org: there is no party axis. An installation is one authority.

     * creating areas is a fleet act. Everything else operational is area-scoped;
     * `area.delete` is area-scoped by ruling (DECISIONS §5.2), for consistency
     * with the other area permissions. The asymmetry is deliberate: operational
     * power is local by default, only fleet-shaping acts are global.
