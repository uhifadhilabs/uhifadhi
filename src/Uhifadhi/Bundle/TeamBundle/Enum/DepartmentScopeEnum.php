/**
 * WHETHER A DEPARTMENT BELONGS TO THE WHOLE ORGANISATION OR TO ONE AREA.
 *
 * IT IS DERIVED, NOT STORED. A department carries a nullable area and nothing
 * else: `area = null` is {@see self::Org}, `area = X` is {@see self::Area}. There
 * is no scope column to disagree with the area, because a stored scope and a
 * nullable area are two facts that can drift apart, and the moment they do one of
 * them is lying. {@see \Uhifadhi\Bundle\TeamBundle\Entity\Department::getScope()} reads it off
 * the area every time.
 *
 * This enum exists so the derived fact has a name the audit trail can record and
 * a screen can group by — an org→area confinement and an area→org promotion are
 * the two transitions {@see \Uhifadhi\Bundle\TeamBundle\Entity\DepartmentScopeChange} logs,
 * and a `from`/`to` pair of these cases is how it says which way the change went.
 *
 * IT GRANTS NOTHING BY ITSELF. An area-level department is the unit that WILL
 * confine a Staff member's authority once the area-aware voter is wired, but
 * that enforcement is not in this bundle yet.
 * Today the scope shapes emphasis and reach on a screen; it never gates data.
