/**
 * THE /team/positions SURFACE — the permission matrix, and the heart of this
 * module. A transcription of the design's own surface declaration
 * (team/positions/positions.widgets.js), which is the specification.
 *
 * THE FIVE MATRIX WIDGETS ARE FIVE RENDERINGS OF ONE ARRAY, and that array is
 * {@see \Uhifadhi\Bundle\TeamBundle\Service\PermissionCatalogue::groupedByUmbrella()}. It is
 * the only input any of them has. They are ALTERNATIVES rather than additions —
 * every preset turns on exactly one — because five renderings of one thing must
 * not be able to disagree about it, and stacking two would be the page
 * disagreeing with itself.
 *
 * WHAT EVERY DIRECTION HAS TO MAKE VISIBLE, because it is the thing that makes
 * this matrix different from every other permission matrix: THE LIST OF
 * PERMISSIONS IS NOT FIXED. Seven are this bundle's and will always be there;
 * the rest arrive when a bundle is installed and leave when it is removed. So
 * every row wears its contributor, and three honest states are drawn rather
 * than described — an installed module that declares nothing, a permission
 * whose module is not installed here, and an orphaned grant still held by
 * positions and provided by nothing.
 *
 * B SHIPS SELECTED, and the argument is the fresh-installation state rather
 * than the populated one: on day one there are no positions, and B is the only
 * direction whose empty state is a single control that makes the first one. The
 * grid opens on nothing at all.
 *
 * F IS NOT A SIXTH RENDERING. It is a different family — five department-first
 * layouts. Where A–E carry the department as context on every row, these carry
 * it as the shape of the page. It is the one preset that shows no matrix
 * rendering and no counts, which is why the KPI-at-the-top rule has nothing to
 * say about it.
