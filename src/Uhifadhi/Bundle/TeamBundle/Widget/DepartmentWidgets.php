/**
 * THE DEPARTMENTS OVERVIEW AS A WIDGET SURFACE.
 *
 * The section's first tab was a fixed page: a band, a strip of figures and six
 * cells in a fixed order, the same for everybody. But what a reader comes to
 * this tab FOR differs by who they are — somebody staffing the organization
 * wants the vacancies and the filled-by-department bars; somebody wiring
 * modules up wants the matrix counts and the departments reading nothing; a
 * director wants the goals. One order cannot be right for all three, and the
 * product already has the answer to that: the surface ships directions, the
 * reader adopts one, copies it and mixes it.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT A WIDGET. The identity band and the "Where this goes on" doors
 * stay page chrome: the band is what the section IS, drawn the same on every
 * tab, and the doors are the way out of it. Neither is a reading anybody would
 * compose differently, and a page whose every last element is arrangeable is a
 * page with no shape of its own.
 *
 * EVERY DESCRIPTION SAYS WHAT THE CARD BUYS AND WHAT IT COSTS, in that order,
 * because a library of nine cards a reader has never seen is a list of nouns
 * without it.
 *
 * A CATALOGUE IS A STATEMENT OF WHAT A SURFACE SHIPS, so this class has no
 * dependencies and nothing may vary it at runtime.
