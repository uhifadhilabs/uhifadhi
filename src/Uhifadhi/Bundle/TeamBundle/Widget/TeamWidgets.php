/**
 * THE /team SURFACE — a transcription of the design's own surface declaration
 * (team/team.widgets.js), which is the specification.
 *
 * Nine widgets in two groups. The six `roster_*` entries are ALTERNATIVES rather
 * than additions: exactly one is on at a time, and every preset turns on exactly
 * one, because they are six ways to lay out the same people and stacking two
 * would be the page saying the same thing twice. The three in `context` are
 * additions — any direction can carry any of them.
 *
 * THE SHIPPED COMPOSITION IS NOT ONE OF THE SIX. It is the roster table with the
 * attention pane above it and the tier explainer below, and it leads the preset
 * strip under its own name, because a fresh installation's first visit to this
 * page is the one where something needs doing.
 *
 * KPI CARDS ALWAYS SIT AT THE TOP. Standing workspace rule, no exceptions — and
 * since a layout's key order is its render order, it is a property of every
 * layout below rather than of a template.
 *
 * EVERY DESCRIPTION IS THE DIRECTION'S TRADE-OFF LINE, verbatim from the design:
 * one sentence naming what the direction buys and what it costs, in that order.
 * What the design said about a direction has to be what the product says about
 * it, or the compare gallery and the product are two opinions.
 *
 * A CATALOGUE IS A STATEMENT OF WHAT A SURFACE SHIPS, so this class has no
 * dependencies and nothing may vary it at runtime.
