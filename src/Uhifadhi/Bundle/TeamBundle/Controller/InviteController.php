/**
 * ADDING SOMEBODY — and BOTH WAYS SHIP.
 *
 * They are not two settings and not a migration: they are two answers to a real
 * difference, which is whether the person is standing next to you.
 *
 * CREATE WITH A PASSWORD needs nothing at all from the deployment — no mailer,
 * no outbound network, no reachable inbox — which is exactly why it is the one
 * that is always available. The person is verified the moment they exist,
 * because an administrator who typed the password has already proved the
 * account is real. It is the only path when a ranger's only address is one they
 * cannot reach from the field. Its cost is operational rather than technical:
 * the password is hashed on save and the product can never show it again, so it
 * has to be handed over in the room.
 *
 * INVITE BY EMAIL ships beside it and starts working by itself the moment an
 * installation has a mailer. Nobody ever knows anybody else's password, which is
 * the whole argument for it.
 *
 * WHERE THERE IS NO MAILER THE PATH IS OFFERED AND REFUSED, NOT HIDDEN. Hiding
 * it would leave an administrator hunting for a feature the product does have;
 * failing silently after the click would leave a colleague waiting for an email
 * nobody sent. So the form is visible, the button is inert, and the reason is
 * written on it. That is the one deliberate exception to this workspace's
 * never-a-disabled-control rule, and the rule's own wording allows it: absence
 * is for a thing that will NEVER exist, and this one is an environment variable
 * away.
 *
 * WHICHEVER WAY IN, THE POSITION IS AREA-SCOPED
 * . A bounded (area-X) administrator adds people only
 * into positions their authority reaches, so the picker offers only those and
 * {@see assignPosition()} refuses a pick past their boundary (a 403). A tier or
 * org-level holder is unbounded and adds anyone anywhere. Leaving the position
 * empty is always fine — a position-less account grants nothing to police.
