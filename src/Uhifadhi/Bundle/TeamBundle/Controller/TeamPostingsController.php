 *
 * IT WRITES NOTHING, AND THE PAGE SAYS SO. A posting is made on the station,
 * in the area that owns the ground; Team reads it. That is why the only
 * control on the page that leaves it goes to the station, and why there is no
 * form here at all — a board that could post somebody would be a second write
 * path for a fact one screen already owns.
 *
 * IT IS THE ONE SCREEN IN THIS SECTION THAT CROSSES A BUNDLE BOUNDARY, and it
 * crosses read-only, through the seam: the ground publishes its stations and
 * the uuids standing at them, this bundle says who they are.
