/**
 * ONE PERSON'S RECORD — the four fields the table has, the tier that decides
 * whether they stand above the matrix, and the position that decides what they
 * may actually do.
 *
 * THERE IS NO DELETE, AND THERE IS NO ROUTE FOR ONE. Accounts are never
 * hard-deleted: "this ranger left in March" and "this ranger never existed" are
 * different facts, and everything the person recorded keeps its author. The
 * action is Deactivate and its opposite is Reactivate. A `deletedAt` marker
 * exists on the model so a future recycle bin is not foreclosed, and nothing
 * here writes it.
 *
 * TWO CHANGES CAN BE REFUSED, and they are refused with their reason rather
 * than greyed out. Demoting or deactivating the last ACTIVE Super Admin leaves
 * nobody who can administer the team, so {@see SuperAdminInvariant} says no —
 * and the page prints the refusal where the control would have been, because a
 * disabled button says "not now" and leaves the reader guessing.
 *
 * THERE IS NO PER-PERSON PERMISSION ANYWHERE ON THIS PAGE, because the model has
 * no such thing. Authority lives on the position; giving one person an exception
 * would mean giving them a position of their own.
 *
 * ASSIGNING A POSITION IS AREA-SCOPED
 * . `#[IsGranted(team.manage)]` is the coarse gate; the
 * position write REFINES it. A bounded (area-X) administrator may reassign only
 * among positions their authority reaches — the one the person holds now and the
 * one they move to must both be in their area — and the picker offers only those.
 * A tier or org-level holder is unbounded and touches anyone. {@see AreaAuthority}
 * computes the boundary; {@see assertMayAssign()} refuses anything past it (a 403).
 *
 * MANAGING THE PERSON THEMSELVES IS AREA-SCOPED TOO (same ruling). Editing the
 * record, deactivating and reactivating are refused when the person is seated
 * OUTSIDE the administrator's authority — a position filed under an org-level
 * department, or another area's. Somebody with no position, or seated in the
 * admin's own area, stays manageable; {@see assertMayManage()} draws that line
 * (a 403), the person-record twin of {@see assertMayAssign()}.
 *
 * EVERY WRITE IS A POST AND EVERY POST IS CSRF-CHECKED.
