/**
 * THE TEAM PAGE — everybody who can sign in to this installation.
 *
 * GATED ON `team.manage`, not on a tier. That is the whole of what retiring the
 * Manager tier bought: the question "may this person administer the team" is
 * asked of the permission catalogue, so a Staff member whose position carries
 * the row gets in and a tier nobody granted does not decide it. Super Admin and
 * Admin pass the same check, because the voter grants them everything by tier.
 *
 * IT IS A WIDGET SURFACE. The body is the person's own resolved layout, so this
 * controller's job is to gather every fact ANY of the nine widgets might want
 * and hand them over — the widget framework decides which are drawn. That is
 * why the roster is fetched twice in different shapes: the table direction is
 * PAGED and the five banded ones are not, because a band cut in half by a pager
 * is a band that lies about its own count.
 *
 * A PLAIN CLASS, extending nothing, with its collaborators handed to it — the
 * reusable-bundle rule (see config/services.php).
