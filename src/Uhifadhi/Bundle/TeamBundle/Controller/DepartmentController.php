/**
 * THE ORG CHART'S HOME — the area-aware department manager, the per-department
 * lens each row opens to, and the writes that shape them.
 *
 * A DEPARTMENT CARRIES A SCOPE NOW, and the manager is built around it. Every
 * department is either AREA-LEVEL — confined to one area, named in the scope
 * column and grouped under that area's heading — or ORG-LEVEL, spanning every
 * area. Area-level come first, grouped by their area's name; org-level after.
 * The scope is derived from the nullable area on the entity ({@see Department}),
 * never stored twice, so the manager only ever reads it.
 *
 * THE AREA IS REACHED THROUGH THE CONTRACT, NEVER AN AREA PACKAGE. The pickers
 * (create, and confine-to-area) enumerate the installation's areas by asking the
 * ORM for the entity the platform's {@see AreaInterface} resolves to — the class
 * whichever area package (AreaBundle) named in
 * `doctrine.orm.resolve_target_entities`. This bundle points at an area exactly
 * as it points at a person, and requires neither package to do it.
 *
 * A DEPARTMENT GRANTS NOTHING DIRECTLY, scope or no scope. Filing a position
 * into a department changes where it is READ; confining a department to an area
 * changes where its people's authority reaches; neither is itself a grant.
 * Capability arrives through a position's permissions, composed one screen over.
 *
 * team.manage IS AREA-SCOPED, so `#[IsGranted(team.manage)]` on every route
 * here is the coarse gate,
 * and the controller REFINES it against the escalation ruling: an area-X admin
 * (a team.manage holder confined to one area) may create, rename and deactivate
 * area-level departments in X, but may NOT mint an org-level department, change
 * any department's scope, or reach an org-level or other-area department — each
 * of those widens power past their own boundary. {@see AreaAuthority} computes
 * the boundary; the write methods refuse anything past it (a 403). Tiers and
 * org-level holders are unbounded and pass every guard.
 *
 * CHANGING A SCOPE IS AUDITED, both directions. Confining an org-wide department
 * to one area, or promoting an area-level one to org-wide, goes through
 * {@see Department::changeScopeTo()} — the one door that refuses a change with no
 * reason and appends a {@see \Uhifadhi\Bundle\TeamBundle\Entity\DepartmentScopeChange}. The
 * controller only supplies who and why; the entity records the transition.
 *
 * A DEPARTMENT DEACTIVATES, IT NEVER DELETES (the standing fleet rule). Winding
 * one down flips its active flag; the register draws it greyed, the pickers drop
 * it, and its scope history and filed positions are untouched. The footprint —
 * how many positions and people it touches — is stated on the act and INFORMS,
 * never guards; {@see reactivate()} brings it back.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE YET. The rich lens surface — a department's
 * widget board, its attached modules and their rolled-up KPIs — is the canonical
 * detail page's follow-up: the Overview and Settings tabs draw the DRAWN empty
 * states for it and nothing is invented behind them.
