/**
 * SIGN IN AND SIGN OUT — the two addresses this bundle owns.
 *
 * AUTHENTICATION ITSELF HAPPENS NOWHERE IN THIS CLASS. The `form_login`
 * firewall — which the installation writes in its own security.yaml, because
 * that file is the application's — intercepts the POST to /login before any
 * controller runs, and the `logout` key intercepts /logout entirely. What is
 * left for a controller is rendering the form and bouncing somebody who is
 * already signed in — which is why login() only ever answers a GET it was
 * allowed to reach.
 *
 * A MODULE MAY SHIP ROUTES; only the shell may not. These two are attribute
 * routes on this class, mounted by the recipe's config/routes/team.yaml the way
 * every other module's are.
 *
 * A PLAIN CLASS, extending nothing, with its collaborators handed to it — the
 * reusable-bundle rule (see config/services.php), patterned on FrameworkBundle's
 * own TemplateController.
