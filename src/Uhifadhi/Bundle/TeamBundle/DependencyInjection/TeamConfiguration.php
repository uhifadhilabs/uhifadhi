/**
 * The module's semantic configuration — how an installation configures identity
 * in config/packages/team.yaml:
 *
 *   team:
 *     after_sign_in_path: /
 *     sign_in_lede: 'Analytical observatory for protected areas.'
 *     mail_from: 'uhifadhi@example.org'
 *     installation_name: 'Ngorongoro Conservation Area'
 *
 * FOUR KEYS, AND NONE OF THEM IS SECURITY. What a deployment usually wants to
 * change about signing in — who may reach what, how long a session lives,
 * whether there is a remember-me cookie — is not here and cannot be: it is
 * the security configuration, which belongs to the installing project (see the
 * bundle class). What IS here is the two things the SCREEN needs and a firewall
 * has no opinion about: where a signed-in visitor is bounced to, and the
 * sentence the card says under the mark.
 *
 * THE TWO MAIL KEYS ARE NOT A MAILER. The transport is `MAILER_DSN` and belongs
 * to the framework; what is here is the two things a LETTER needs that no
 * transport has an opinion about — the address it comes from, and what to call
 * this installation in the subject line. `mail_from` defaults to empty on
 * purpose: an empty from-address is what makes {@see \Uhifadhi\Bundle\TeamBundle\Service\Mail::isConfigured()}
 * answer no, so an installation that configured a transport and forgot the
 * address is told at the moment of ASKING rather than at the moment of sending.
 *
 * The tree is closed, so an invented key fails loudly.
 *
 * Static so the tree is testable with a plain Processor and shared verbatim by
 * the bundle's configure().
