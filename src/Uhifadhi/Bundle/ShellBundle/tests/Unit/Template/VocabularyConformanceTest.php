 * THE SHELL HELD TO THE RULE IT PUBLISHES.

 * It is the start of every chain, so it links nothing beside its own two
 * sheets and there is no chain above it to restate. What it does owe is the
 * other direction: it owns the design system, so a class its own templates
 * write and no rule of its own defines is a class nobody in the platform has.
 *
 * ONE RULE HERE IS THE SHELL'S ALONE. The widget library's sheet loads beside
 * the design system's on the same page, so it may reach for a shared class —
 * the toolbar puts a `.tgl` at the end of its row — only qualified by a class
 * of its own, or the rule escapes the library and re-styles a `.tgl` on
 * somebody else's page.
