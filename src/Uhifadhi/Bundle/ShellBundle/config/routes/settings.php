/*
 * THE SETTINGS SECTION'S ONE ADDRESS — shipped as a resource, loaded by nobody
 * here, exactly like the welcome page's and the configure page's. An
 * application asks for it in one line, in a file it owns:
 *
 *     # config/routes/shell.yaml (your application)
 *     shell_settings:
 *         resource: '@ShellBundle/config/routes/settings.php'
 *
 * An installation that never imports it has no settings section and no row in
 * the sidebar for one — the navigation source generates this route and yields
 * nothing when it cannot.
 *
 * THE SCREEN IS A TRAILING OPTIONAL PARAMETER, which is what makes the ruled
 * order visible in the URL: the section's FIRST screen is the bare address and
 * every other screen hangs one segment below it. `/settings` is the overview
 * and `/settings/installation` is what is installed, and the router generates
 * the bare form on its own whenever no screen is named. The same shape a
 * configure page's sections wear, for the same reason.
 *
 * ONE ROUTE, NOT FOUR, because the set of screens is declared once — in
 * Uhifadhi\Contracts\Settings\SettingsTab — and a route per screen would be a
 * second list to keep in step with it. The requirement below is deliberately
 * the shape of a segment rather than an enumeration of the four for the same
 * reason; a segment that names no screen is refused by the controller, with a
 * 404 that says which.
