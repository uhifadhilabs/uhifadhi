/**
 * THE SIDEBAR'S CONTENT, COLLECTED — and nothing else.
 *
 * This class asks every registered source what goes in the nav, orders the
 * answers, checks the one invariant a nav has, and hands the result to a
 * template. It decides nothing about who may see a row: the shell holds no
 * authorization service and asks nothing about the viewer, because a renderer
 * with opinions about the team model would be the second place in the platform
 * where a permission is interpreted. A row the viewer may not have never
 * arrives here.
 *
 * READ LIVE. The sources are iterated on every call and nothing between them
 * and the sidebar caches, which is what makes "switch a module off" take effect
 * the same day rather than after a deploy.

     * ONE HEADING PER GROUP. A section label is a PLACE in the sidebar, not a
     * thing a source owns: two modules that both file a row under System have
     * named the same place, so the heading is drawn once with every contributed
     * row under it. A heading drawn twice would tell a reader there are two
     * Systems, which is a sidebar answering "where am I" with a lie.
     *
     * AND THERE ARE FOUR PLACES, NAMED IN THE CONTRACT. A label that is not one
     * of {@see NavGroup::ORDER} is refused here, by name, with the four in the
     * message: a near-miss ("Organization", "Org") used to grow a fifth heading
     * that nobody designed, silently, in whoever's installation had that module.
     *
     * THE GROUPS ARE DRAWN IN THE CONTRACT'S ORDER — Observatory, Organization,
     * System, Settings — and a contribution's `position` orders its ROWS inside
     * its group. That is the split a contributing module can actually answer:
     * where its row sits among the System rows is its business, where System
     * sits among the headings is the shell's.

    /**
     * WHAT IS OPEN, AND WHICH ROW WEARS THE ACCENT — derived here, for the
     * whole sidebar, from the one thing that is true of a render: where the
     * viewer is. RULED 2026-09-20.
     *
     * Four rules, and nothing else decides:
     *
     *   1. Only the ANCESTOR PATH of the current row is open. Every other
     *      section is closed to its own row — Areas is one row while you are
     *      in Files, Performance is one row while you are in an area. A tree
     *      that opens everything it could open is a wall of rows, and the
     *      thing a sidebar is for is answering "where am I".
     *   2. Open means ONE RUNG. A row shows its children, never its
     *      grandchildren; only the path runs deeper, because the viewer is
     *      standing in it. The row the viewer is ON shows its own children
     *      too — the page and the rows under it then say the same thing.
     *   3. ONE GROUND PER TREE. The row the viewer is on is `current` — the
     *      accent, the ground, the focus line — and every row it hangs off is
     *      `path`: the accent as ink and nothing else. A source that marked
     *      the whole path (and they do, because the invariant above is stated
     *      per sibling list) marked the path, not four current rows, and this
     *      is where that becomes the two classes the design draws.
     *   4. NO PAGE DECIDES ITS OWN TREE. Whatever a source passed for `open`
     *      is overwritten here. It was the honest thing to pass while each
     *      source derived its own subtree; the result was that a page's tree
     *      read differently depending on which bundle drew it, and a reader
     *      cannot learn a sidebar that changes shape under them.
     *
     * The viewer's own folds are not here and cannot be: they are the tab's,
     * they arrive after the render, and the browser keeps them for the
     * session against the key this gives each row.
