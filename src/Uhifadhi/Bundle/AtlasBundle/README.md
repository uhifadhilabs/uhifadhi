# AtlasBundle

The **atlas**: the component library every module's visuals are drawn with. Today that is maps —
one map builder, one plate, one basemap contract with a configurable satellite provider, the
boundary drawing, and the chrome every map in the product wears. Charts and calendars are the
same shape and are coming.

One of the bundles of the uhifadhi core, `uhifadhi/uhifadhi`. It can be installed on its own as
`uhifadhi/atlas-bundle`.

## What it is

Mechanism, not a screen: this bundle owns no entities and no pages. What it owns is everything a
map is made of before anyone decides what to draw on it.

It is **infrastructure**, not a capability. The platform has two tiers:

- a **capability** module (patrol, incident) is the per-area grid — an admin switches it on, it
  arrives default-off, and it is ledgered per area in `area_module`;
- **infrastructure** is machinery every relevant screen already imports — installed means on,
  everywhere, never a per-area choice, never in the catalogue, the grid, or the ledger.

The atlas is infrastructure because patrol plates, incident plates, the area overview and the zones
editor all draw with its assets: an installation without it does not have fewer features, it has
broken screens. That is not an opt-in, so it is not offered as one. It contributes **no**
`uhifadhi.module` provider — nothing for the registry to collect, no catalogue tile, no ledger row,
no route to gate. It is guaranteed present by the composer graph instead: `AreaBundle` requires it.

## Install

The core is one package:

```bash
composer require uhifadhi/uhifadhi
```

Flex registers the bundle, writes `config/packages/atlas.yaml`, and writes the three importmap
entries. The atlas is built on [Symfony UX Map](https://symfony.com/bundles/ux-map/current/index.html)
and its Leaflet bridge, so an installation also registers `UXMapBundle` and names the renderer:

```yaml
# config/packages/ux_map.yaml
ux_map:
    renderer: 'leaflet://default'
```

The bundle registration (`config/bundles.php`) — the recipe's `bundles` block:

```php
Uhifadhi\Bundle\AtlasBundle\AtlasBundle::class => ['all' => true],
```

The three importmap entries are written by Flex, not by the recipe; what lands in a host, and the
two conditions it depends on, are in [shipping importmap assets from a
bundle](docs/importmap-assets.md).

## Getting started

**Publish the configured provider on your `<body>`** (`templates/base.html.twig`) — the one
line still yours to write, because it goes in a template only you own:

```twig
<body {{ map_basemap_attributes() }}>
```

Every map on every page then draws the configured imagery — the host's own maps and each module's
plates alike. There is no per-template and no per-module wiring, which is the point: the same layer
must render identically everywhere.

**Link the map stylesheet** wherever a map renders — the plate, the chrome, the legend and the
fullscreen rules:

```twig
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset(constant('Uhifadhi\\Bundle\\AtlasBundle\\AtlasBundle::STYLESHEET')) }}">
```

Leaflet needs no step at all. The UX Map Leaflet bridge imports it from the importmap and imports
its stylesheet with it, so there is exactly one Leaflet on the page and this package ships no copy
of its own.

The satellite imagery is `esri` by default and needs no key; choosing another provider is
[choosing the satellite imagery](docs/satellite-imagery.md).

## A map in four lines

```php
$map = $this->maps->createMap();                 // MapBuilderInterface
$map->boundary(new Boundary($areaGeoJson));
$map->addLayer(new GeoJsonLayer(id: 'sightings.recent', label: 'This week', features: $collection));
```

```twig
{{ render_map(map, {'role': 'img', 'aria-label': 'Sightings this week'}) }}
```

That is the whole of it: the imagery the deployment configured, the boundary drawn the platform's
one way, the control stack, the legend with a switch per layer, and fullscreen. A module writes no
JavaScript — the full guide is [the atlas components](docs/components.md).
