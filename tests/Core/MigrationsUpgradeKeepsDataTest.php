/**
 * THE UPGRADE LOCK: a release can be applied to a database that already has
 * people in it, and every `down()` is real.
 *
 * Two separate promises, and they are not the same promise:
 *
 * 1. **`up()` keeps what is there.** Rows written through the bundles' own
 *    services survive every further `migrate`, which is the only thing an
 *    installation upgrading actually does.
 * 2. **`down()` round-trips the SCHEMA, and only the schema.** These versions
 *    create tables, so their inverse drops them, and dropping a table drops its
 *    rows — a `down()` that pretended otherwise would be a lie. What is proven
 *    here is that the whole history can be unwound to nothing and re-applied
 *    without error, which is what makes `down()` worth shipping: it is the
 *    rehearsal an operator does before an upgrade, not a data-safe undo.
 *
 * The rows are seeded through `TeamContentProvider`, the same declaration devkit
 * materialises in a development installation — real services, real validation,
 * no hand-written INSERT.
 *
 * @see src/Uhifadhi/Bundle/TeamBundle/Devkit/TeamContentProvider.php
